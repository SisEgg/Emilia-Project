# Emilia-Project
Beatmap Nominator tracker for osu! 

Not really sure how GitHub works but I'll learn.. eventually

Emilia is a web-scraper for tracking [osu!](osu.ppy.sh) Beatmap Nominator's profiles which will usually contain information that will help
other mappers keep track of BN activity. The overall purpose of Emilia is to be a stalker that will know everything you like and 
everything you do if you're a Beatmap Nominator. ~~It's programmed in JavaScript with the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) module.

Going to use Python instead since osu! API doesn't support me! integration.. yet

Modeled a bit after [Aiess](https://github.com/Naxesss/Aiess) and Victoria made by [Naxess](https://github.com/Naxesss)

### Note
Closed-source at the moment since I'm pretty anxious to give out my precious Emilia and I don't want people seeing my spaghetti code.

## Contact me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/r8mTuVm) or Sisig#5406 if you have any queries.
